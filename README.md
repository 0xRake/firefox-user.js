# Firefox user.js configuration files
---
### Overview
  These `user.js` files are modified whenever there are new software upgrade to the firefox browser and are tailored specifically to my own personal preferences.

### Resetting Inactive Prefs
---
  The script resets all inactive prefrences after a firefox has been restarted. It should be run within the profile directory which holds the Firefox preferences.
